        <h1>The Phantom Guitar</h1>
        <a href="https://punchthrough.com/bean/"><img src="resources/imgs/lightbluebean.jpg" alt="Light Blue Bean"></a>
        <p>The Phantom Guitar is the perfect mix of two of my childhood hobbies: playing guitar, and arduinos/embedded development. I eventually
            had the great idea to bring both of my hobbies together. I found the LightBlue Bean by PunchThrough (Click on the picture to learn more) which
            was a perfect fit for my project.<br><br>The LightBlue Bean is a BLE device and works much like an Arduino, except over Bluetooth Low Energy. It
            has an LED, accelerometer and numerous I/O pins.<br> I wrote iOS and MacOS apps where the user can select guitar chords to play,
            and then use the Bean like a guitar pick, strumming in air while getting the feeling and sound of playing a guitar.

        <h1>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</h1>
        <a href="https://joeyrobert.org/projects/ultimatetictactoe/"><img src="resources/imgs/uttt.jpg" alt="Ultimate Tic Tac Toe"></a>
        <p>When I first learnt iOS and Android programming, I decided to make the simple but fun game
            of Tic-Tac-Toe. Then, I found out about Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, a much harder version of the
            same game (to try the game, click on the picture).<br><br>
            Playing the usual small Tic-Tac-Toe is much easier than playing the same game on 9 boards with a bunch of new rules. It was also
            a challenge to code it, but I enjoyed the challenge. This project helped me understand how important Object Oriented Programming is, because I
            was able to create one single board and make 9 of the same boards, making my task much easier.

        <h1>"Quotes" Android App</h1>
        <a href="https://apkpure.ai/quotes-13"><img src="resources/imgs/quotesfinal.png" alt="Quotes Android App"></a>
        <p>When I first started programming in High School, smartphones were just gaining popularity. There were not many apps on the market.
            The idea of programming an Android Application was really cool for me. I had just learnt Java when I found out I could
            easily download Android Studio and get on my way to creating my first Android application.<br><br>
            I made a simple application that displayed my favorite quotes. I also added handy features like saving your favorite quotes,
            adding new quotes, and a neat chalkboard theme, which I thought was great at the time.<br><br>Click on the picture to see the app.

        <h1>Traffic Light Controller</h1>
        <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"><video class="vid" controls autoplay><source src="resources/vids/trafficlight.mov" type="video/mp4">Can't load video.</video></a>
        <p>As part of a college class, I have started working with Raspberry Pis. I have worked extensively with Arduinos in the past, but this was my first
            introduction to Raspberry Pi. Although Pis contain a full OS and may be used as a desktop, they are similar to Arduinos in some ways. (click on the picture to learn more) <br> <br>
            We designed a traffic light controller which is shown in the accompanying video. Using the Raspberry Pi for logic and control, the two LEDs act as stop lights.
            The push button acts as a button for pedestrians to press when crossing the road. Then, the countdown provides them time to cross the road and then the light turns back to red.
            <br><br>This was a great introduction to Raspberry Pis and it invigorated me to experiment and tinker with them more.
