        <h2><a href="resources/pdfs/myresume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a></h2>
        <p>My passion has been Computer Engineering for as long as I can remember. I enjoy the software as well as the hardware aspects
            of Computer Engineering. My work has usually reflected that.<br><br>
            My first work experience came with MAYU (now called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/type-art-animated-text-videos/id1085777076">Type Art</a>). This is
            an iOS app with which you can create beautiful animated texts. I worked with a startup in Israel developing this app when I was in High School, using my iOS app development knowledge. <br><br>
            The summer of freshman year of college, I interned at a company called <a href="https://www.bioeye.com/">BioEye</a>. I worked on a project involving machine learning to provide a
            mobile eye tracking solution. I also worked on their back end, using technologies like Node.js and MongoDB.<br><br>
            In Summer 2019, I worked as a Software Engineering intern at <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-us.html">National Instruments</a>. This was my first experience working
            at a larger Computer Engineering company. I worked on a project involving embedded development through which I learned a lot about how
            hardware and software works together.<br><br>
            I have also worked as a Computer Science Peer Teacher and Physics Undergraduate Teaching Fellow at Texas A&M University, regarding non Computer Science jobs. I will be
            interning at <a href="https://www.boeing.com/">Boeing</a> next summer in Seattle.
